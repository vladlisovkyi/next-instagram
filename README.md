✅ Implemented: Developed an Instagram clone featuring essential functionalities such as user authentication (sign-in/sign-out), the ability to create new posts, like posts, and add comments. All these actions are securely stored within the Firebase database. The user-friendly design is responsive and ensures a seamless experience across devices. To enhance efficiency within the Next.js framework, I utilized Recoil, a state management library, to effectively pass props.

🧑‍💻Technologies Used: Next.js, React, Next-Auth, FireBase, TailwindCSS
